# Dance-Website-PIlot-Project---HomePage-
The following is only a homepage based website, node js is used as backend in this. 


This project can easily be run on vscode.
Remember to unzip the node modules folder while u run this project. 
The node modules folder contains all node js modules, since they were too much in number i had to zip them unfortunately.
